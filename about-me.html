   <h1>About me</h1>
   <p>My name is Sara Nazari, an 18-year-old educator and technology enthusiast from Afghanistan. I come from a large, dynamic family where education and dedication shape our way of life. My passion lies in both teaching and technology, two seemingly different worlds that, for me, come together harmoniously.

    I currently work as a tutor in Mathematics, Physics, and English, helping students strengthen their academic foundations with clarity and confidence. Alongside teaching, I am a recently admitted scholar in the TTS (Transition To Success) program at the American University of Afghanistan (AUAF) — an opportunity that has allowed me to deepen my , leadership potential, and commitment to education.
    
    My curiosity extends beyond the classroom. I am deeply passionate about web development and coding, where I find joy in solving logical problems and creating user-centered digital experiences. For me, coding is not just technical work — it's an art form, a creative outlet, and a tool for empowerment.
    
    I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning, and my goal is to merge education and technology to make learning more accessible, meaningful, and exciting — especially for young girls in underrepresented communities.</p>
